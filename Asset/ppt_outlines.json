Common for prediction and classification.\n    *   *Example:* Training with historical house prices (features) and their sale prices (label) to predict a new home's value.\n*   **Unsupervised Learning:** Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Common for grouping and association.\n    *   *Example:* Segmenting customers based on purchasing behavior without predefined categories.\n*   **Reinforcement Learning:** An agent learns through trial-and-error to maximize rewards in an environment.\n    *   *Example:* A program learning to play a video game by receiving points for successful actions.\n\n**Slide 3: Anatomy of a Machine Learning Model**\n*   **The Algorithm:** The mathematical process (e.g., decision tree, neural network) that finds patterns.\n*   **Features & Labels:** Features are the input variables (e.g., square footage, bedrooms). The label is the target output (e.g., sale price).\n*   **Training & Inference:** The model is *trained* on historical data. It is then used for *inference* to make predictions on new, unseen data.\n\n**Slide 4: A Common Workflow: From Data to Deployment**\n*   **1. Data Preparation:** Collecting, cleaning, and formatting data (often 80% of the project effort).\n*   **2. Model Training & Evaluation:** Training the algorithm, then testing its accuracy on held-out data to avoid overfitting.\n*   **3. Deployment & Monitoring:** Integrating the model into a real application and continuously monitoring its performance.\n\n**Slide 5: Real-World Applications and Key Takeaway**\n*   **Everyday Applications:** Recommendation systems (Netflix, Spotify), fraud detection, voice assistants, and image recognition.\n*   **Not Magic:** ML is a powerful tool built on statistics and data, not artificial general intelligence. Its outputs depend entirely on the quality of its training data.\n*   **Core Value:** It automates and scales complex pattern recognition, enabling insights and automation beyond human capability."
